# Latitudes
![](assets/latitude-circle-of-lines.png)
- All lines are same distance apart
- separated by 69 miles i.e. 1 degree = 69 miles
![](assets/latitude-degree.png)
- Each degree is subdivided into 60 minutes 
- Similarly each minute is divided into 60 seconds

# Longitude

- lines of Longitude are not equal distance
# Degree measurement
![](assets/earth-degree-measurment.png)
This is called `2-d trilateration`
# Example

# Altitude 
- Represent height
![](assets/altitude.png)
- For earth, we use for elevation map
